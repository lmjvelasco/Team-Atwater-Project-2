# Team Atwater's Project 2
### Goals
For Project 2, we are interested in studying low-cost, affordable diets for marginalized populations in the US below the income threshold with type 2 diabetes.

Our goals include:
1. Evaluate nutritional content of diets for low-income communities in food deserts
2. Develop meal plans for families restricted by type 2 diabetes by income level
3. Mimic cultural diets
